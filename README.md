## Documentation and Design process
Our team put the documentation into wiki:https://github.com/EddieCarroll1/DECO3500/wiki

## Installation
Robodog's installation is built across two different code bases, Arduino and Processing. In order to run the code, you need a to have your own dog,
and run processing program with the port updated to whatever port is plugged into your Arduino. The processing code will then wait for your dog to send a signal
Once a signal is recived through the serial port, the processing script will in turn play audio relevent to that scenario.  

## Hardware
The interactions with the dog were simulated to provide the user with their experience. 
The dog is quite simple, it consists of an Arduino with an IR receiver Sensor connected, I used the duinotech XC-4427 sensor. 
Once that was attached and powered an IR remote is used to simulate each of the different experiences.


## Ownership
All aspects both physical and virtual were built and programmed by: </br> Edward Carroll S4480633.
